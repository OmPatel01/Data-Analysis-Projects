# International Student Demographics in US

## 1. Overview of Project:
The International Student Demographics Power BI project aims to analyze and visualize data related to international student enrollment across universities in the United States. Using Power BI, we explore trends, patterns, and demographics spanning from 2007 to 2022, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the education sector.

## 2. Key Insights:
This comprehensive report comprises four insightful pages:

- **Student Enrollment Overview:** This page provides a comprehensive overview of student enrollment trends, academic details, and funding sources. It includes visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, and treemaps to showcase enrollment statistics and funding distribution.
  
- **Academic Details and Fields of Study:** Here, we delve into academic details and fields of study pursued by international students. Visualizations include pie charts and donut charts illustrating academic types, majors, and fields of study.

- **Student Status and Demographics:** This page focuses on student demographics and status, exploring insights such as gender distribution, marital status, and visa types. Visualizations include pie charts, bar charts, and line charts depicting demographic trends.

- **Funding and Financial Analysis:** In this section, we analyze funding sources and financial aspects related to international student enrollment. Visualizations include pie charts and bar charts showcasing funding sources and financial trends over time.

## 3. About Dataset:
The dataset comprises six tables:
- **Academic Details:** Provides information on academic types, levels, and student counts.
- **Field of Study:** Contains data on majors, fields of study, and student counts.
- **Funding Sources:** Includes details on funding types, sources, and student counts.
- **Student Status:** Provides insights into student demographics, status, and visa types.
- **Enrollment Statistics:** Offers statistics on student enrollment, including year-wise trends and academic types.
- **Student Origin:** Contains data on student origin regions, countries, and academic types.
- **Measures Table:** A supplementary table containing calculated measures and metrics for analysis.

## 4. Use of Relationships, DAX, and Measures:
- **Relationships:** Establishes relationships between tables to facilitate seamless data navigation and analysis.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Utilizes DAX formulas to create calculated columns and measures, enhancing data analysis capabilities.
- **Measures:** Implements measures to encapsulate complex calculations and derive actionable insights from the data.

## 5. Use of Different Visualizations:
The project employs various visualization techniques to present insights effectively:
- **Bar Charts:** Used to compare categorical data and visualize trends over time.
- **Pie Charts:** Depict proportions and percentages of data categories.
- **Donut Charts:** Similar to pie charts, with a hole in the center for additional information.
- **Line Charts:** Display trends and patterns over time or continuous variables.
- **Tree Map:** Visualizes hierarchical data using nested rectangles.
- **World Map:** Illustrates geographic distribution and trends across regions.
